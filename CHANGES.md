These are the changes made to the original aBUS implementation:

- Formatted the original code base with `ruff`.
- Changed folder structure to contain everything needed in the `parallel_abus` package.
- Updated numpy API calls to the newest version, to avoid deprecation in np.percentile
- Added lambda as return parameter in serial aBUS_SuS
